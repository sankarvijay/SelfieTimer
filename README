CamTimer is a simple camera timer application for Android devices. It allows you to choose from a 5, 10, or 15 second countdown and takes one or four pictures after the time has elapsed. After you take a picture it will be shown full screen, allowing you to share or delete it.

You can also control the camera flash setting, switch to the front-facing camera if available (requires Android 2.3 or later), and take pictures without a delay.
